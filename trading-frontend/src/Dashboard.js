        <h2 style={styles.heading}>üè† Domestic Trading</h2>
        <p style={styles.text}>
          <strong>Domestic Trading</strong> involves the exchange of goods and services within the boundaries of a single country.
          It is governed by local laws, regulations, and market conditions.

          <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Retail sales, wholesale distribution, and local service contracts.</li>
        </ul>

      {/* International Trading Section */}
      <section style={styles.section}>
        <h2 style={styles.heading}>‚úàÔ∏è International Trading</h2>
        <p style={styles.text}>
          <strong>International Trading</strong> is the exchange of goods, services, and capital across national borders.
          It involves more complexity due to customs, tariffs, currency exchange, and international laws.
        </p>
        <ul style={styles.list}>
          <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Managing currency risk, compliance with import/export regulations, and ensuring timely logistics.</li>

          <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Access to wider markets, potential for higher profits, and diversification of supply sources.</li>
          <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Exporting raw materials, importing machinery, and cross-border e-commerce.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      {/* LOC, Finance, Trade Exchange Sections */}
<section style={styles.section}>
  <h2 style={styles.heading}>üìú Letter of Credit (LOC)</h2>
  <p style={styles.text}>
    A <strong>Letter of Credit (LOC)</strong> is a financial document issued by a bank on behalf of a buyer,
    guaranteeing that the seller will receive payment for goods or services provided, provided that the seller meets the terms specified in the LOC.
    It is commonly used in international trade to mitigate risks such as non-payment or shipment issues.
  </p>
  <ul style={styles.list}>
    <li><strong>How it works:</strong> The buyer arranges an LOC with their bank, which promises to pay the seller once the seller presents documents proving shipment or delivery.</li>
    <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Protects both buyers and sellers, facilitates trust in cross-border transactions, and provides financing flexibility.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style={styles.subheading}>üìå Types of Letters of Credit</h3>
  <ul style={styles.list}>
    <li><strong>Revocable LOC:</strong> Can be changed or canceled by the issuing bank without the consent of the seller. Rarely used due to its risk for exporters.</li>
    <li><strong>Irrevocable LOC:</strong> Cannot be altered without agreement from all parties. Provides strong payment assurance for the seller.</li>
    <li><strong>Confirmed LOC:</strong> A second bank (usually in the seller's country) adds its guarantee of payment, in addition to the issuing bank.</li>
    <li><strong>Unconfirmed LOC:</strong> Only the issuing bank is responsible for payment. Riskier for sellers in unstable markets.</li>
    <li><strong>Sight LOC:</strong> Payment is made immediately upon presentation and verification of required documents.</li>
    <li><strong>Usance (Deferred) LOC:</strong> Payment is made after a specified credit period (e.g., 30, 60, 90 days after shipment).</li>
    <li><strong>Transferable LOC:</strong> Allows the beneficiary (seller) to transfer part or all of the credit to another party (like a supplier).</li>
    <li><strong>Back-to-Back LOC:</strong> Two linked LOCs where the buyer uses a master LOC to secure a secondary LOC for another transaction.</li>
    <li><strong>Standby LOC:</strong> Acts more like a guarantee than a traditional LOC‚Äîonly pays if the buyer defaults.</li>
    <li><strong>Red Clause LOC:</strong> Allows the seller to receive an advance payment before shipping, often used to finance production or procurement.</li>
  </ul>

<section style={styles.section}>
  <h2 style={styles.heading}>üí∞ Trade Finance</h2>
  <p style={styles.text}>
    <strong>Trade Finance</strong> refers to the financial products and instruments that companies use to facilitate international trade and commerce.
    It ensures exporters receive timely payment and importers can finance their purchases.
  </p>
  <ul style={styles.list}>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Reduces risks related to currency fluctuations, political instability, and payment defaults.</li>
    <li><strong>How it helps:</strong> Enables companies to optimize cash flow, secure working capital, and expand into global markets with confidence.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style={styles.subheading}>üìå Types of Trade Finance Instruments</h3>
  <ul style={styles.list}>
    <li><strong>Letter of Credit (LOC):</strong> Guarantees payment to the seller upon meeting certain conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>Bank Guarantee:</strong> A promise by a bank to cover losses if a buyer defaults on a trade agreement.</li>
    <li><strong>Export Credit:</strong> Government-backed or private loans to help exporters sell to foreign buyers.</li>
    <li><strong>Factoring:</strong> The exporter sells their accounts receivable (invoices) to a third party (factor) at a discount.</li>
    <li><strong>Forfaiting:</strong> Similar to factoring, but for medium/long-term receivables, often with larger transactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Trade Credit Insurance:</strong> Protects sellers from the risk of non-payment by buyers.</li>
    <li><strong>Supply Chain Finance (Reverse Factoring):</strong> Buyers arrange for early payment to their suppliers through a financial institution.</li>
    <li><strong>Pre-shipment Finance:</strong> Short-term finance provided to exporters before goods are shipped.</li>
    <li><strong>Post-shipment Finance:</strong> Working capital provided to exporters after the shipment has occurred and documents have been submitted.</li>
    <li><strong>Open Account:</strong> Goods are shipped before payment is due. It's high risk for sellers but often used in trusted relationships.</li>
  </ul>
