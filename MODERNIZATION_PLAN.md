# Modernization Plan for Trading Platform Microservices

## 1. Python & FastAPI
- Upgrade all services to Python 3.12+.
- Upgrade FastAPI to the latest version.

## 2. Dependency Management
- Migrate from requirements.txt to Poetry for all services.
- Remove unused dependencies and update all packages to latest stable versions.

## 3. Async SQLAlchemy & Pydantic v2
- Upgrade SQLAlchemy to 2.x and refactor for async usage.
- Upgrade Pydantic to v2 and update models as needed.

## 4. Testing & Quality
- Add/upgrade pytest, pytest-asyncio, and coverage.
- Add Ruff (linter), Black (formatter), and pre-commit hooks.

## 5. Docker & CI/CD
- Refactor Dockerfiles for multi-stage builds and smaller images.
- Update GitHub Actions workflow:
  - Add matrix builds for Python versions.
  - Add Trivy for security scanning.
  - Add deployment and notification steps (already present).

## 6. Observability & Monitoring
- Integrate OpenTelemetry for tracing.
- Add Prometheus metrics endpoints.
- Add Sentry for error tracking.

## 7. Security & Secrets
- Use python-jose for JWT.
- Add security headers middleware.
- Use GitHub Actions secrets for CI/CD; recommend Vault or AWS Secrets Manager for production.

## 8. Messaging & Eventing
- Integrate Redis Streams or Kafka for event-driven communication (optional, for future scaling).

## 9. Documentation
- Add/upgrade API docs (Swagger, ReDoc).
- Add MkDocs for project documentation.

## 10. Cloud Native
- Prepare for Kubernetes with Helm charts and GitOps (ArgoCD/Flux).

# Upgrade Script (Poetry, Python, Linting, Testing)

```sh
# 1. Install Poetry
pip install poetry

# 2. For each service (example: loc-service)
cd trading_platform/loc-service
poetry init --no-interaction --python=^3.12
poetry add fastapi sqlalchemy[asyncio] asyncpg pydantic pytest pytest-asyncio coverage ruff black python-jose[cryptography] httpx
# Add other service-specific dependencies as needed
poetry install

# 3. Remove requirements.txt if migration is complete
rm requirements.txt

# 4. Add pre-commit hooks
poetry add --dev pre-commit
cat <<EOF > .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: stable
    hooks:
      - id: black
  - repo: https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff-pre-commit
    rev: v0.4.0
    hooks:
      - id: ruff
EOF
pre-commit install

# 5. Repeat for all other services
```

# Next Steps
- Upgrade Dockerfiles for multi-stage builds.
- Refactor code for Pydantic v2 and SQLAlchemy 2.x async.
- Integrate OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and Sentry as needed.
- Update GitHub Actions workflow for matrix builds and security scanning.

For each step, I can generate the exact code, Dockerfile, or config changes. Let me know which service to start with or if you want to automate the upgrade for all at once.
